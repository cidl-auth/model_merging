# Model Merging for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Financial Trading System

This repository presents an open-source model designed to merge multiple financial trading models within a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) pipeline. The core contribution is the implementation of the model merging method. This method allows the development of a model that
combines the knowledge of multiple individual models.
